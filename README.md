# EC2B1_Coursework

In this repository you will find two Jupyter notebooks:
- Germany.ipynb
- Indonesia.ipynb

Both notebooks are identical except for the value of the 'country_selection' variable but for ease we have duplicated the original notebook and prefilled the values of 'country_selection' for both Indonesia and Germany.

---

There is also a python script called reg_functions.py which includes the definitions of 5 functions used during the analysis stage of our project. They are to be used for calculating trend paths for our variables.

Finally, you will find two folders that include the PNG files of all of our graphs - one for each country.
